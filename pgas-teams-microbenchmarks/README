====================================================

Teams Microbenchmarks is a new suite we specifically developed for
a research work that studies how the memory hierarchy can be exploited to
optimize teams implementation in CAF programs. This newly developed Coarray Fortran, CAF2.0 and MPI Teams Microbenchmarks suite contains a set of microbenchmarks for
testing reductions, broadcasts and barriers within teams. Also, we estimate the overhead of the creation of a new team.
